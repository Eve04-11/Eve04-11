# 👋 Hi, I'm Hewan (Eve04-11)

I'm a self-taught beginner developer currently building apps focused on accessibility and social impact. I'm especially passionate about autism-focused tech after volunteering at the Melu’e Foundation for 2 years.

🔧 I’m currently working on:
- 🎧 **Autism Sensory App** – a sound-based calming tool for non-verbal kids
- ✅ **Mini Task Tracker** – a productivity app using Python/JavaScript
- 🌐 **Portfolio Site** – my first personal webpage!
